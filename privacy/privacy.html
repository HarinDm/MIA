We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information that has not been anonymized and/or aggregated. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google.

This allows us to provide targeted advertising in the future. If you do not wish to receive this type of advertising from us in the future you can opt out using the DoubleClick opt-out page or the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.</p><p>Google has additional information available about its Remarketing Privacy Guidelines, Policies, and Restrictions on its website.</p><p>Google Tag Manager</p><p>The Site uses Google Tag Manager. Google Tag Manager is a solution that allows marketed website tags to be managed using an interface. The Tag Manager tool itself (which implements the tags) is a cookie-less domain and does not register personal data. The tool causes other tags to be activated which may, for their part, register data under certain circumstances. Google Tag Manager does not access this information. If recording has been deactivated on domain or cookie level, this setting will remain in place for all tracking tags implemented with Google Tag Manager.</p><p>How We Use Your Information</p><p>We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal data:</p><p>To provide you the Mia Helps Programs and the content and the other products and services that you request from us.</p><p>To provide the Site, the Mobile Apps and the other Mia Helps Services and content that is on them to you.</p><p>To process and complete transactions, including registration for the use of the Mia Helps Programs and the other Mia Helps Services and send you related information.</p><p>To provide technical and other support to you.</p><p>To send you promotional communications, such as providing you with information about services, features, surveys, newsletters, offers and events; and providing other news or information about us.</p><p>To enable Service Providers to perform certain responsibilities and provide certain services in connection with the Mia Helps Services and our business and operations.</p><p>To fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it.</p><p>To provide you with notices about your account.</p><p>To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection.</p><p>To notify you about changes to the Mia Helps Programs, the Site, the Mobile Apps and the other Mia Helps Services.</p><p>To enhance the safety and security of all of the Mia Helps Services.</p><p>To verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity.</p><p>To enable marketing, remarketing and targeted advertising and similar services from us or Service Providers, including direct and indirect marketing and on-line behavioral advertising regarding our own and third-party products and services that we believe may be of interest to you, including advertisement on third party websites.
